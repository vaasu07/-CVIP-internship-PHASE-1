# Customer Behavior Analysis with Transactional Data

## Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on understanding and analyzing customer behavior based on transactional data. The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive valuable insights into customer preferences, purchasing patterns, and overall behavior using Google Colab.

## Project Structure

- **data:** Contains the dataset used for analysis (e.g., transactional data).
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and modeling.
- **scripts:** Any scripts used for data processing or analysis.
- **images:** Visualizations and plots generated during analysis.
- **README.md:** Overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Usage

1. Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.

2. Clone the repository in the notebook:

   ```python
   !git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-behavior-analysis.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory:

   ```python
   import os
   os.chdir('customer-behavior-analysis/notebooks')
   ```

4. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in sequential order:

   - `01_data_cleaning.ipynb`
   - `02_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`
   - `03_modeling.ipynb` (if applicable)

5. Follow the instructions within each notebook to execute the code and analyze the data.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into customer segments, purchasing patterns, correlations between products, seasonal trends, and anomalies in transactional data. These insights can be used to inform marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, and enhance customer satisfaction.
